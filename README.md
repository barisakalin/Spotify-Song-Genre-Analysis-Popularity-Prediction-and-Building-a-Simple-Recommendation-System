# Spotify-Song-Genre-Analysis-Popularity-Prediction-and-Building-a-Simple-Recommendation-System

This code belongs to one of the project of data science course I did when I was a aophomore student in university. We are given a dataset which consist of some .csv files. In these csv files; informations about the artist, the year of release, the genre, and features like the acousticness, danceability, popularity, etc. of many songs can be accessed. I added this dataset to the repository as two .zip files. The project consists of three parts:  \
\
1)Exploratory Data Analysis\
-Visualizations descriptive statistics of the dataset; visual explanations of features & sharing distributions\
-Example visualizations of aggregated forms based on features\
-Analysis of the most popular artists and songs\
\
2)Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing\
-Statistical tests to check how (or if) features contribute to popularity of songs\
\
3)Machine Learning\
-Prediction of song popularity with various machine learning models\
-Efforts on hyper-parameter tuning to increase the performance of models\
